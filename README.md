## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- meedia queries for RWD

### What I learned

Another fun project from Front End Mentor. Built with custom CSS, Flexbox, and media queries. Nothing earth shattering but good practice. There is a data.json file that I did NOT use to dynamicaly populate the results. I normally do not write custom CSS variables. I did take thhe time to do for this short project. It does makes the code more legible but was not a time saver at this scale.

### Continued development

I would like to build the main layout in CSS grid and then use Flexbox as needed. Eyeballing margins and padding is time consuming and can be inaccurate.
